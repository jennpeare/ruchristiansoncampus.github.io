        <h3>Become grounded in your faith</h3>
        <p class="small text-center">Having been rooted and being built up in Him, and being established in the faith even as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving. &mdash; Colossians 2:7</p>
        <p>As you start your college career, it is important to continue in your walk with the Lord and to become further grounded in your faith. Freshmen Connect provides an atmosphere that will assist you in starting your Christian walk with the Lord at college in a strong and healthy way.</p>

        <h3>Pursue the Lord with other Christians</h3>
        <p class="small text-center">But flee youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. &mdash; 2 Timothy 2:22</p>
        <p>The Bible reveals that the Christian race is not meant to be run alone. At Freshmen Connect, you can meet other freshmen like you with whom you will be able to flee and pursue like it says in 2 Tim. In addition to students your age, you can meet and get to know older students and Christian mentors who are all eager to run the race with you and help you along the way.</p>

        <h3>Discover your destiny in God’s purpose</h3>
        <p class="small text-center">God placed eternity in man’s heart... &mdash; Ecclesiastes 3:11</p>
        <p>What is the meaning of life? God has a very definite, clear plan, and you are at the very center of it. Hear what the Bible has to say about what God has been doing throughout history, as never seen before in the Word.</p>
