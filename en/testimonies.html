          In Rutgers Christians on Campus club, I learned that it is not a small matter to spend time with other brothers and sisters <em>in</em> Christ. Both in spiritual knowledge and experience, I learned that it is most beneficial if gained with and for "those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart" (2 Tim 2:22). The topmost portion of Christ is there in the Body! By the Lord’s mercy and lovingkindness, I was able to keep in touch with the Lord all throughout college years because I was <em>with</em> the saints. Presenting myself at meetings and bible studies even at my lowest conditions still gave the Lord a way to touch me through the saints and the "Christ who is all and in all" (Col 3:11). As it takes time for a plant seed to grow, surely it will take time for <em>the seed</em> to grow in a person. Looking back, it was the same in my experiences in the club; the environment was nurturing and necessary for Christ to grow in me. Let us praise Him as the Head, "out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love" (Eph. 4:16).

          Prior to being part of Rutgers Christians on Campus, I had participated in multiple church events in my hometown that included retreats and youth group exercises. When I met the brothers and sisters in RCOC, I immediately felt welcome. I was so glad to find believes in Christ on my college campus. It allowed me to be able to worship and pray with the brothers and sisters while juggling a steep workload of a college student. They welcomed me with open arms and I enjoyed some of the events they held such as fellowship home meetings and studying for finals with the group. I was unsure if college would give me a chance to continue to practice my faith with others, but I am so happy I found RCOC to help me advance my knowledge about Christ and continue to worship him on a daily basis.

          My name is Priscilla Etienne and I am currently a senior majoring in Public Health here at Rutgers University. I joined Christians on Campus during the spring semester of my sophomore year and I have been meeting with them ever since. My experience with Christians on Campus is one that cannot be compared to any other club that I have been a part of during my college experience. I have learned so much about myself and have grown a lot spiritually and it is due to the guidance that this club was able to provide to me. Meeting with other club members is always the highlight of my week and being amongst so many like-minded people helped keep me on the right track during my times of need. The size of this club was perfect for me and wasn’t so big that I felt like I would get lost in the crowd. We all were able to have our voices heard and openly shared our experiences with each other. My relationship with the other club members and alumni has grown a lot and they have not only become my friends but are like a second family to me.

          <h4>Scott Smart</h4>
          My name is Scott Smart, I am a senior at Rutgers and have been with Christians on Campus since I was a freshman. I became a Christian when I was 11 years old, but did not have any impactful experiences of the Lord until I was in college. As a freshman not really knowing what it meant to be a Christian, I had the experience of coming to know Christ in a more real and subjective way and to seek Him corporately with other believers, mainly through my meeting here with the club. My life has been changed through the support and love poured out by the club members and alumni over the years, and by the grace and mercy of the Lord and the prayer of all the saints I know I can be standing here today, able to pursue and love Christ, and to be for His interest here on earth today. Being here with Christians on Campus has shaped my college years, and reshaped my life.
