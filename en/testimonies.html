          In Rutgers Christians on Campus club, I learned that it is not a small matter to spend time with other
          brothers and sisters <em>in</em> Christ. Both in spiritual knowledge and experience, I learned that it is most
          beneficial if gained with and for "those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart" (2 Tim 2:22). The topmost
          portion of Christ is there in the Body! By the Lord’s mercy and lovingkindness, I was able to keep in touch
          with the Lord all throughout college years because I was <em>with</em> the saints. Presenting myself at
          meetings and bible studies even at my lowest conditions still gave the Lord a way to touch me through the
          saints and the "Christ who is all and in all" (Col 3:11). As it takes time for a plant seed to grow, surely it
          will take time for <em>the seed</em> to grow in a person. Looking back, it was the same in my experiences in
          the club; the environment was nurturing and necessary for Christ to grow in me. Let us praise Him as the Head,
          "out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich
          supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the
          building up of itself in love" (Eph. 4:16).

          Prior to being part of Rutgers Christians on Campus, I had participated in multiple church events in my
          hometown that included retreats and youth group exercises. When I met the brothers and sisters in RCOC, I
          immediately felt welcome. I was so glad to find believes in Christ on my college campus. It allowed me to be
          able to worship and pray with the brothers and sisters while juggling a steep workload of a college student.
          They welcomed me with open arms and I enjoyed some of the events they held such as fellowship home meetings
          and studying for finals with the group. I was unsure if college would give me a chance to continue to practice
          my faith with others, but I am so happy I found RCOC to help me advance my knowledge about Christ and continue
          to worship him on a daily basis.

          My name is Priscilla Etienne and I am currently a senior majoring in Public Health here at Rutgers University.
          I joined Christians on Campus during the spring semester of my sophomore year and I have been meeting with
          them ever since. My experience with Christians on Campus is one that cannot be compared to any other club that
          I have been a part of during my college experience. I have learned so much about myself and have grown a lot
          spiritually and it is due to the guidance that this club was able to provide to me. Meeting with other club
          members is always the highlight of my week and being amongst so many like-minded people helped keep me on the
          right track during my times of need. The size of this club was perfect for me and wasn’t so big that I felt
          like I would get lost in the crowd. We all were able to have our voices heard and openly shared our
          experiences with each other. My relationship with the other club members and alumni has grown a lot and they
          have not only become my friends but are like a second family to me.

          <h4>Scott Smart</h4>
          My name is Scott Smart, I am a senior at Rutgers and have been with Christians on Campus since I was a
          freshman. I became a Christian when I was 11 years old, but did not have any impactful experiences of the Lord
          until I was in college. As a freshman not really knowing what it meant to be a Christian, I had the experience
          of coming to know Christ in a more real and subjective way and to seek Him corporately with other believers,
          mainly through my meeting here with the club. My life has been changed through the support and love poured out
          by the club members and alumni over the years, and by the grace and mercy of the Lord and the prayer of all
          the saints I know I can be standing here today, able to pursue and love Christ, and to be for His interest
          here on earth today. Being here with Christians on Campus has shaped my college years, and reshaped my life.
